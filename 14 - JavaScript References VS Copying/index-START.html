    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team1 = players.slice();
    console.log(team1)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team2)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    team3[3] = 'heee hawww';
    console.log(team3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    console.clear()

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number:99, age:12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      sociail: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    
    console.log(dev);
